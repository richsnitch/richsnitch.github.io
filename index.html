        <p class = "about">Now, let's learn a little bit more about me!<br> My name is Hayden Richards and I graduated from St. Thomas May of 2024.<br>
            Major: <i>Computer Science</i><br>Minors: <i>Teacher Education</i> and <i>Applied Statistics</i></p>
        <p class = "mainPar"> I began learning how to code during the fall of 2021. As a student, math and problem-solving were two of my strongest skills, and that has certainly translated
		over to computer science. Throughout my time at St. Thomas, I learned a variety of languages, including Python, Java, MIPS, HTML, and CSS. From simple programs to large-scale projects,
		I have learned a lot over these last few years. Despite the challenge in learning how to code, I have grown to embrace it and hope to use my skills to make a positive impact on this world.
            <br><br><b>Goals</b>: One of my current goals is to release a game on Steam. My friends and I have begun doing some work in Godot, a game engine that uses its own built-in
	language, called 'GDScript.' We have many ideas, from simple platformers to full RPGs, so we will see where that takes us!</p>
